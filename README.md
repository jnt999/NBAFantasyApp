### Markdown

Markdown is the lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for making this website. TO learn all the syntax (theres not much) check out [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jnt999/NBAFantasyApp/settings). I forget what theme this is but it looks kinda nice. When you have time go to that link and check out the other to see if you like them.

Check out the site on your phone. it actually looks good. Im trying to figure out how to put dynamic graphs and buttons on here
